# Node.js training

In this project under guidance of lynda tutorials I have had hands on experinece in learning and understanding Node.js. 
Node.js is a powerful tool for controlling the web servers, building applications and creating event driven programming. In this 
course you learn how to intsall Node.js and use it in a development enviroment through a text editor like sublime text, 
which is easier for you to go back and forward between various files while programming. Also I learned about a modules 
and express frameworks for app development. Finally I learned how to unit test my code, start sessions on web servers, 
stream data and create simple command line tools.
